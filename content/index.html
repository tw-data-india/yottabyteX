        title: "Continuous Insights"
        speaker: "Shankar Ramakrishnan & Rajagopal PS (Data Engineer - Thoughtworks)"
        subtitle: "In the modern world, data is the most valuable asset to any company. Companies are trying to put data and analytics at the forefront to become data driven organisations. The dynamic and continuously growing nature of data makes it harder to analyse and create actionable insights. Becoming a data driven company is not a one day process, rather it is a continuous process of delivering and adopting insights. <br/> Due to the uncertain nature of data, Running a data initiative needs different approaches and techniques. We are going to explore how to run data projects effectively by delivering continuous data insights in a lean & iterative fashion to meet business goals. <br/> Prerequisites: <br/> - Basic understanding of Agile/SDLC process <br/> - Interest/working on data projects <br/> - Interest in CD4ML, Data BA/PM or Already one"

        title: "Scaling your organization using Data Mesh architecture"
        speaker: "Syed Atif Akhtar & Sambhav Gupta (Data Engineer - Thoughtworks)"
        subtitle: "With Data gaining traction and companies trying to be more 'data driven', there are some common patterns of failure. These common patterns are more pronounced in large scale enterprises and projects. <br/> In this talk we try to explore these reasons and build a framework by tying together best practices and our own first principles at ThoughtWorks to build a view of the data mesh. The data mesh as a technique provides a way of structuring your teams and providing names to certain practices to build a business first domain oriented approach to tackling Big Data problems. <br/> We will demo a very specific implementation towards the end and try to put together a visualization and understanding of how the data mesh tackles some of these key challenges defined here-: https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/techniques/data-mesh."

        title: "Evolution of Data Lakes"
        speaker: "Balvinder Khurana & Sarang Shinde (Data Engineer - Thoughtworks)"
        subtitle: "Data lakes are most often initial steps in making an organization data driven. With maturity in real-time/streaming technologies, data is populated at real time in the data lakes. Once data is collected and available at a common location; it can be used for multiple requirements, starting from simple visualizations and insights generation to intelligent predictions and prescriptions. This might require some transformation on the consumed data, some of these use cases include writing and reading data concurrently, data versioning for data science, auditing for compliances and updates, merging and deleting of specific records. Doing this on files which are core to the Data Lake is very difficult and hence we need support for transactions similar to what traditional databases provide. <br/> In this talk we will discuss the common challenges, some custom solutions, and how data lakes have evolved from batch oriented no update data stores to transaction data stores. We will also touch upon various formats such as ORC, Delta Lake, Apache Hudi and Apache Iceberg which help in creating reliable data lakes."

        title: "Building a robust and scalable Streaming Platform"
        speaker: "Sunder R, Dinesh Kumar S & Jeremy Jackson (Data Engineer - ThoughtWorks)"
        subtitle: "Distributed stream computing is now an unavoidable processing paradigm. It allows to get results continuously and in real time from huge volumes of fresh data. Apache Kafka is currently the most popular framework used to ingest the data streams into the processing platforms. However, most of us struggles on attaining the full potential of this streaming framework and fails to leverage some good practice for efficient streaming platform. How to tune Kafka and how much resources to allocate for it remains a challenge for most users, who now rely mainly on empirical approaches to determine the best parameter settings for their deployments. <br/> In this talk we are planning go through several configuration and performance metrics of Kafka in order to allow user to find the bottlenecks, build configuration tailor made for the use-case in hand and how to leverage some of the good practice for efficient stream processing."

        title: "Expense Audit: attacking a traditional business problem with new age AI Solutions"
        speaker: "Prashant Vijay (Co-Founder and CEO - Egregore Labs)"
        subtitle: "A common problem in companies is auditing employee expenses. While expense management has digitised and automated the expense submission and approval process to a large extent, audit and approval are still manual, and require a deep focus. Due to each individual expense not being meaningful enough, manager approvals are offer rubberstamps, and the onus lies on Finance teams to audit expenses. Finance teams often audit only 5-15% of expenses with sampling or other selection mechanisms. End result is wastage, fraud, risk, and human time. <br/> We will explore how our solution helps automate this, using Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing."

        speaker: "Chetan Chhabra (Data Scientist -Thoughtworks)"
        subtitle: "Google like search is the need of almost every enterprise.Employees may need to search various internal documents and information. Deep Learning and NLP has now attained such advancements that , it can extract answers from context to the fact based questions asked by users. <br/> In this talk we will disuss some of the methods to behind development of extractive Question and Answer system."
