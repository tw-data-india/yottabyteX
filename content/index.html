        title: "Decipher Delta Lake Architecture"
        speaker: "Nisha Kumari, Divya Dua"
        subtitle: "With the advent of big data, WORM and lambda architecture based tools outclassed the data systems. With time, CDCs, Schema evolution, ACID transactions became inevitable and the architecture evolved to process data and update data lake as data arrives.<br/>This talk aims to explore the &quot Delta Architecture &quot, deep dive on concepts of Data Skipping and ZORDER Clustering to understand how they preserve locality and fine tune queries against huge data sets."

        title: "Data Quality: the holy grail for a Data Fluent Organization"
        speaker: "Balvinder Khurana, Devangana Khokhar"
        subtitle: "Organizations face a multitude of challenges in their journey towards becoming a data-fluent organization. These challenges keep getting more and more complex, owing to different factors ranging from market pressure, lack of systems thinking around data, differing opinions on what's the need of the hour for the organization all the way to the technology litter. However, the common denominator for most of these challenges remain to be just one factor - data quality, or the lack thereof. In this talk, Devangana and Balvinder will talk about different ways in which data quality issues manifest themselves and recommendations to address them systematically, especially when working with large-scale, data-centric enterprise systems."

        time: "5:30 - 6:15 pm"
        title: "Metadata: Oil for fourth pillar of data platforms"
        speaker: "Madhu Podila, Shakti Garg"
        subtitle: "When we talk about data platforms, we mostly focus on golden domain data and deriving value out of it. Architecturally, we have talked about different strategies of  ingestion, processing and data persistence, which are three pillars for a data platform.<br/> In this talk, we will focus on the importance of metadata to build a successful data platform and how it enables the fourth pillar of data governance in a data platform"

        time: "6:15 - 6:30 pm"
        title: "Deep Learning in EEG Signal Analysis"
        speaker: "Priyanshi Shah"
        subtitle: "EEG signals are helpful in the medical industry which can help in detecting electrical activity of the brain.This is an emerging field. These signals occur in different frequencies stored as waveforms. There lies numerous use cases in the mental health industry for emotion detection, epilepsy , arousal states for a patient in coma , etc.<br/> Deep Learning plays an important role in the predictive analysis and also in processing of these raw signals. A brief talk on its methodologies and use cases. "

        title: "Mastering the security in decentralised GCP data mesh implementation"
        speaker: "Anusuya Ramasamy, Sundaramoorthy Sivasamy"
        subtitle: "Handling security is one of  the top priorities in the data mesh environment.There could be multiple projects in an organization. Our goal is to alert the Security personnels for the security and data risks across an organization.  But the alerts should not be spamming the security personnels inbox, rather alerting only for the configurable security vulnerabilities.Our solution is widely accepted by the infosec team and currently getting implemented for all the GCP projects created in the data platform."

        time: "4:00 - 4:15 pm"
        title: "Wav2vec 2.0: A self-supervised approach to ASR (Let's do ASR with very small amount of labeled data on Indic languages)"
        speaker: "Anirudh Gupta, Aman Tiwari"
        subtitle: "Speech-to-text applications have never been so plentiful, popular or powerful, with researchers’ pursuit of ever-better automatic speech recognition (ASR) system performance bearing fruit thanks to huge advances in machine learning technologies and the increasing availability of large speech datasets.<br/>Current speech recognition systems require thousands of hours of transcribed speech to reach acceptable performance. However, a lack of transcribed audio data for the less widely spoken of the world’s 7,000 languages and dialects makes it difficult to train robust speech recognition systems in this area.<br/>To help ASR development for such low-resource languages and dialects, a new self-supervised language learning approach has been open sourced by Facebook. By using that we have made our own ASR system for Indic languages like Hindi, Tamil, etc. Which are on par with current ASR’s with very less amount of labelled data."

        title: "Speaker Recognition in the Wild"
        speaker: "Neeraj Chhimwal"
        subtitle: "This utility was developed to aid data preparation for an Indic Speech Recognition model. Our goal was to find number of speakers and the audios belonging to them in a large audio source, with no labels to begin with. We'll go through the steps taken and our insights while trying to find unique speakers in a sea of unlabelled utterances, using deep feature embeddings."
