subheader: "State Management in Angular"
subnote: Angular is a popular web application framework and as the applications grow large there are multiple components we have to manage. There are a lot of places from where the state gets updated and it gets very difficult to manage the state. We will cover why we need state management, what are the different types of states and how can we manage it more effectively. The sessions are hands-on, so please bring along your laptops.
