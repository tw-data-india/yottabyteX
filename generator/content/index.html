    title: "Infrastructure as code(IAC)"
    speaker: "Surjeet Singh"
    subtitle: "If you feel you are putting too many efforts in managing your dynamic infrastructure or if you are bogged down by the instability of your infrastructure or probably doesn't feel confident to push unattended changes across your infrastructure, this talk is what you've been looking for. We'll start with some challenges that we face when we manually handle the infrastructure, discuss some principals of IaC and how tools and practices, when applied to IaC, from the software engineering can help us to manage the Infrastructure confidently. Finally, we'll look at some examples and demo to get some more understanding around IaC. Terraform as IaC tool along with AWS cloud just happens to be the medium for the demo."

    title: "Ansible by Example"
    speaker: "Rohit Garg & Sanjeev Upreti"
    subtitle: "Ansible has been chosen by a vast majority of people for managing their IaC because of its extensibility, yet separation of concerns. There is a plethora of modules and roles available for helping us do tasks that ease out our day to day concerns. We present to you a different take on this tool, where we would talk about deploying and managing a game server of Urban Terror. Yes, we play after hours on some days."

While Docker containers are great for DevOps, they also present new security challenges that both security practitioners and developers must understand and address with diligence. Dockerâ€™s team of security experts has built some valuable security features into the Docker platform over the last several years. Let's talk about how containers and hosts can be hardened as the first step toward a more secure container environment."
